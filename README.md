This program takes quotes from "https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes"
Divides each quote into words
Takes one word at a time and sparates it according to its length
It's divided into three spans if the length allows it
And puts the 'center' letter in the middle span with a style of color: red
If it finishes a quote it will automatically go to the next quote,
If the user doesn't press 'Stop' before moving to the next quote
If the user press 'Stop' and then 'Start' it will also move to a new quote 


These actions are performed in a sequence of time chosen by the user
The user can set the speed that they want the word to appear
This speed is shown in the WPM (Words per minute) text
Changing every time the user moves the range of the speed


If the page is reloaded the 'Speed' will be the one saved in the localStorage
